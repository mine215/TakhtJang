# TakhtJang
A custom game designed for servers that use a child of CraftBukkit as their JAR.

# Setup
Clone the repo and use maven build to build the plugin. Next import it into your custom server (1.8) and run it once. Once you have a configuration file, build a map (or use the sample world files) and customize the config file to work with your map (or don't if you use the sample world).
