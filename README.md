# TakhtJang
A custom game designed for servers that use a child of CraftBukkit as their JAR.

# Setup
Clone the repo and use maven build to build the plugin and start the server normally. The server backup is incase something hapens to the main world.

# FAQ
**Q**: Will the plugin ever be made customizable so that it can be used with a custom world?

**A**: Yes. At the moment I am just refining the plugin so that it works on my custom world and will start adding customization later on once it is refined and has enough features.
